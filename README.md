# node-gyp-test

This is a simple skeleton app that can be used to test if your node-gyp build environment is working.

Alternatively, use this as a starting point for your native module.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm --silent start
```

> Should print "Hello, World!" to the console.
